# Guestline Test Assessment

## Goal and requirements

Goal is to create a page showing a list of hotels and their rooms.

- Filter based on the star rating of the hotel, that is, given I have selected 3 stars, then I am able to see all hotels with a 3 and above rating.
- Filter based on the capacity of the room. That is, when I have selected 1 adult and 1 child then I am able to see all rooms with at least that capacity Therefore, I will not be shown any rooms which do not accept children.
- View all images of the displayed hotel
- See hotel details (including hotel name, address and star rating) and room details (including room type, max adults, max children and long description)
